### Transactions  
- All-or-nothing: Like taking ALL groceries out before paying, ensuring data consistency.
- Valid state: Like putting wine back or spilling it, making sure the database always makes sense.
- Rules
    - **Must have semicolons ";" at every line**

#### Working with strings: 
```yaml
lpad = rjust do python 
coalesce =  accepts an unlimited number of arguments. It returns the first argument that is not null.
replace = replaceAll do javascript - REPLACE ('AAAA AA', 'A', 'Z');

```
